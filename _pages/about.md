I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), previously at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC). My research focuses on AI/ML applications in social network security, privacy, and natural language processing (NLP). I am particularly interested in leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) to understand and address challenges in digital identity, content moderation, and behavioral analysis on social platforms.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked for over eight years as a software engineer at companies such as BRAC IT, REVE Systems, and AES, where I contributed to ERP systems, NLP pipelines, and customer engagement platforms. My practical experience includes full-stack software development, chatbot architecture, system integration, and scalable AI solution deployment.

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from BUET, which provided me with strong theoretical and technical foundations. My research has resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications at conferences like ASONAM and COMPSAC. I was also a finalist in the 2023 U.S. Dept. of Energy CyberForce Competition and a recipient of the National Project Champion Award in Bangladesh.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and social network security. My current research focuses on leveraging large language models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques to tackle privacy risks, identity deception, and content manipulation in online social platforms.

Specific areas of interest include:

- Social Network Security and Privacy
- Explainable Machine Learning and Concept Drift
- Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, GPT)
- Adversarial Behavior and Content Moderation
- Real-world Applications of AI in ERP Systems and User Behavior Modeling

My recent work involves designing intelligent frameworks for combating identity attacks, mitigating echo chambers, and detecting gender bias in regional language content on social networks.
